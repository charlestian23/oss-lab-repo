3. Ask questions to make sure you understand what the questioner understands, so you don't need to explain things that they already know. Additionally, if applicable, write down your answer to the question so it can be used as reference if you believe it will be a common question.
4. This article, to me, shows why the open source movement is a much healthier environment for software developers. Software developers are able to suggest and make changes to other people's projects and promote collaborative environment. It also is crazy to me that Jesse spent a lot of time making improvements, but he was the one that was punished at the end of the day. It would seem logical that his changes such as adding a button to prevent crashes should be applauded since his modifications can benefit the community at large. I also question RIAA's decision to want to prevent Jesse from working in basically any related technology field for the rest of his life. To me, if Jesse paid the money and admitted to the copyright crimes, that's all the RIAA should have needed to be satisifed. On an unrelated note, this also shows an inherent flaw in the American legal system, which is that despite having a good argument and a good potential to win, Jesse had to take the settlement for monetary reasons. However, as a computer science student and not a law student, I'm not sure how exactly you could fix the legal system to avoid scenarios.

## Part 6
I want to make sure that the maintainers of the repository have good programming principles. Even if I am really interested in a particular project, if the project's maintainers don't practice good coding practices and have unreadable code, I would rather not spend my time pulling my hair out trying to read what is happening. This along with my interest in the project and my belief that I can contribute something meaningful are all I need to be interested in an open source project.
