3. It is important to choose a license because it lets people know the permissions, conditions, and limitations of using your code. Doing so also legally protects your software, which is important in an open source project. Without a license, people might be hesitant to use your code because they may think that they could be sued for violating copyright laws.
4. If a repository does not have a license, then you cannot assume that the project is open source. By default, the project is copyrighted by the developers working on the project. While you may be allowed to modify the project if the project is published on GitHub due to its Terms of Service, the safe route to take is to simply assume that all rights are reserved.
5. I do agree with the claims presented in the passage. I think that Gopher would've benefitted a lot more from transparency, and that the lack of transparency was its downfall. I think this is especially true since Gopher was developing technology that was in its infancy. Software such as Windows and macOS that have been around for decades may not need as much transparency since they will probably never fundamentally change.
6. Google wanted to use a permissive license. As stated in (1): "These licenses encourage commercial adoption of open-source software because they make it possible for companies to profit from investing in enhancements made to   existing open-source software solutions. That potential for proprietary investment on top of an open stack is most likely what inspired Google to adopt the Apache Software License for its mobile platform. Availability of Android under the ASL will ensure that a broader number of companies will be able to adopt the platform and build on top of it without having to expose the inner workings of proprietary technologies that give them a competitive advantage" (Paul). This permissive license also allows phone manufacturers to make proprietary customizations on top of Android for their own needs.
